Method 1: With the Windows Media Creation Tool
What you do:

Get the official Windows Media Creation Tool from Microsoft's website.

Run the tool on your current Windows computer.

Choose the option for making installation media for another PC.

Choose the Windows version, language, and architecture (32-bit or 64-bit).

Insert your USB drive and choose it as the target device.

The tool will automatically download the Windows install files and prepare the USB.

When done, you have a bootable USB to install Windows.

Software tools needed:

Windows Media Creation Tool (free from Microsoft)

USB size:

At least 8 GB (some ones need 16 GB if it's Windows 11 or bigger ISO)

Multiple boots in one USB, can you?

No, this tool creates one Windows installer. For multiple OS installers in one USB, you need advanced methods.

Method 2: Using Rufus (Third-party tool)
What do you do:

Download the Windows ISO file from Microsoft or any other source.

Download and execute Rufus (free lightweight utility).

Put in your USB stick.

In Rufus, select your USB drive and the Windows ISO file.

Select partition scheme (MBR or GPT) as per your PC's boot mode (Legacy BIOS or UEFI).

Click "Start" and Rufus will format and copy files to boot your USB.

Once done, you can boot from this USB to install Windows.

Software utilities needed:

Rufus (free, at https://rufus.ie/)

Windows ISO file (downloaded from Microsoft)

USB size:

Minimum 8 GB for Windows 10 and later.

Can you perform multiple boots from one USB?

By default, Rufus will create a single-boot USB. But using advanced configuration or other specialized tools (like Ventoy), you can make a multiboot USB.
